MIDI Captain MAX — Firmware Installation
========================================

1. Connect your MIDI Captain to your computer via USB.
2. Wait for it to mount as a drive (CIRCUITPY or MIDICAPTAIN).
3. Copy ALL files and folders from this zip to the device drive,
   replacing any existing files.
4. The device will restart automatically after the copy completes.
   If it doesn't, unplug and replug USB.

Files included:
  code.py          Main firmware entry point
  boot.py          Startup configuration
  config.json      Default config (STD10)
  config-mini6.json  Default config (Mini6)
  core/            Firmware modules
  devices/         Hardware definitions
  fonts/           Display fonts
  lib/             CircuitPython libraries (included, no separate install needed)

Note: If you already have a config.json on your device with
custom button mappings, don't overwrite it — keep your existing one.

The firmware auto-detects your device type (STD10 or Mini6).

MIDI Captain MAX — Firmware Installation
========================================

Prerequisites:
  - CircuitPython 7.x installed on your device
  - Device connected via USB and mounted as CIRCUITPY or MIDICAPTAIN

Recommended: Use deploy.sh (macOS/Linux)
------------------------------------------------

  First install (includes CircuitPython libraries):

    ./deploy.sh --install

  Update existing firmware:

    ./deploy.sh

  Options:
    --install     Full install with CircuitPython libraries
    --eject       Eject device after deploy (forces clean reload)
    --fresh       Overwrite config.json with default
    --libs-only   Only install CircuitPython libraries

  deploy.sh auto-detects your device type and preserves your
  existing config.json (button mappings, colors, etc.).

Manual Installation (Windows or if deploy.sh is unavailable)
------------------------------------------------

  1. Connect your MIDI Captain via USB.
  2. Hold Button 1 (upper-left switch) while powering on.
  3. Copy ALL files and folders to the device drive,
     replacing existing files.
  4. The device restarts automatically after the copy completes.
     If not, unplug and replug USB.

  Important: If you have a custom config.json with your own
  button mappings, keep your existing one — don't overwrite it.

Recovery
------------------------------------------------

  If the device ends up in a bad state, it's fully recoverable:
  mount the device again, erase the contents, and copy the
  firmware files again.

  deploy.sh        Installation script (recommended)
  code.py          Main firmware entry point
